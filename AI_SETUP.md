# AI Image Analysis Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Google Cloud Vision API for automatic card information extraction from photos.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Cloud Vision API for your project

### 2. Create a Service Account

1. In Google Cloud Console, go to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts"
2. Click "Create Service Account"
3. Give it a name like "vision-api-service"
4. Grant it the "Cloud Vision API User" role
5. Create and download the JSON key file

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

#### For Local Development:
Add to your `.env` file:
```
GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEY_FILE=path/to/your/service-account-key.json
```

#### For Railway Deployment:
1. Copy the entire JSON content from your service account key file
2. In Railway dashboard, add environment variable:
   - Key: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS`
   - Value: The entire JSON content (as a single line)

### 4. Test the Setup

1. Start your backend server
2. Take a photo of a trading card using the app
3. The AI should automatically extract card information and suggest a search query

## üîß How It Works

### Image Analysis Process:
1. **Photo Capture** - User takes photo or uploads image
2. **Text Detection** - Google Vision API extracts all text from image
3. **Pattern Matching** - App analyzes text for card information:
   - Player names (e.g., "Tom Brady", "LeBron James")
   - Years (e.g., "2020", "1999")
   - Brands (e.g., "Topps", "Panini", "Magic: The Gathering")
   - Grades (e.g., "PSA 10", "BGS 9.5")
   - Card numbers (e.g., "1/100", "25/50")
4. **Search Generation** - Creates optimized search query
5. **Auto-fill** - Populates search box with suggested query

### Supported Card Types:
- **Sports Cards** - Baseball, Football, Basketball, etc.
- **Trading Card Games** - Magic: The Gathering, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!
- **Graded Cards** - PSA, BGS, SGC, CGC
- **Raw Cards** - Ungraded cards

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### Photo Quality:
- Ensure good lighting
- Focus on the card text/details
- Avoid glare and shadows
- Capture the entire card when possible

### Text Recognition:
- The AI works best with clear, readable text
- Handwritten text may not be recognized
- Very small text might be missed
- Multiple cards in one photo may cause confusion

### Search Optimization:
- The AI suggests search terms based on detected information
- You can always modify the suggested search
- Use the advanced search tips for better results

## üîí Security & Privacy

- Images are processed by Google Cloud Vision API
- No images are stored permanently
- Text extraction happens in real-time
- All processing is done securely through Google's infrastructure

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"No text detected in image"**
- Check photo quality and lighting
- Ensure text is clearly visible
- Try taking photo from different angle

**"Failed to analyze image"**
- Verify Google Cloud credentials are correct
- Check that Vision API is enabled
- Ensure environment variables are set properly

**"Service account not found"**
- Verify the service account key file path
- Check that the JSON credentials are valid
- Ensure the service account has proper permissions

### Debug Mode:
Enable debug logging by checking the browser console for detailed error messages.

## üì± Mobile Optimization

The AI analysis is optimized for mobile use:
- Works with both camera photos and gallery uploads
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Fast processing for quick card identification
- Offline-friendly (analysis happens on server)

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Future Enhancements:
- Card condition assessment
- Price estimation from images
- Multiple card detection
- Handwriting recognition
- Card authenticity verification

### Custom Patterns:
You can extend the pattern matching in `services/imageAnalysisService.js` to support:
- New card brands
- Different grading companies
- Special card types
- Custom text formats
