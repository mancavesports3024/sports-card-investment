- Calculates health score

### 2. Fix Phase
- **Player Names:** Calls the specific player name fix endpoint
- **Summary Titles:** Runs the summary title update process
- Applies fixes with proper error handling

### 3. Verification Phase
- Re-scans the database after fixes
- Calculates improvement percentage
- Reports final results
