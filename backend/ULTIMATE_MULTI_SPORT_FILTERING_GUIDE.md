## 💰 Price Thresholds by Sport

The system uses sport-specific price thresholds to filter out outlier sales:

| Sport | Raw Cards | PSA 9 | PSA 10 |
|-------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Basketball | $600 | $1,200 | $2,400 |
| Football | $500 | $1,000 | $2,000 |
| Baseball | $400 | $800 | $1,600 |
| Hockey | $300 | $600 | $1,200 |
| Soccer | $400 | $800 | $1,600 |

## 🔍 Grade-Specific Filtering

### Raw Cards
- Must NOT be graded (PSA grade = 0)
- Must contain meaningful content (3+ meaningful words)
- Must be within sport-specific price threshold

### PSA 9 Cards
- Must be exactly PSA 9 grade
- Must contain meaningful content
- Must be within sport-specific price threshold

### PSA 10 Cards
- Must be exactly PSA 10 grade
- Must contain meaningful content
- Must be within sport-specific price threshold

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
const { ultimateMultiSportFilter, detectSport } = require('./ultimate-multi-sport-filtering-system');

// Test a card
const card = {
    title: "Luka Doncic Orange Ice Prizm #9",
    price: { value: "25.50" }
};

const sport = detectSport(card.title); // Returns "basketball"
const isRawCard = ultimateMultiSportFilter(card, 'raw'); // Returns true
const isPSA9Card = ultimateMultiSportFilter(card, 'psa9'); // Returns false
```

### Integration with Hybrid Price Comparison
```javascript
// In hybrid-price-comparisons.js
const { ultimateMultiSportFilter } = require('./ultimate-multi-sport-filtering-system');

function searchPriceComparisons(cardTitle) {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Filter results using ultimate multi-sport system
    const rawCards = results.filter(card => ultimateMultiSportFilter(card, 'raw'));
    const psa9Cards = results.filter(card => ultimateMultiSportFilter(card, 'psa9'));
    const psa10Cards = results.filter(card => ultimateMultiSportFilter(card, 'psa10'));
    
    // ... rest of function ...
}
```
