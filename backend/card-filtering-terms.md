## IMPORTANT NOTES

### Terms to NOT Filter (Legitimate Player Names)
- wayne, gretzky, aaron (these are legitimate player names and should NOT be filtered)

### Special Cases to Handle
- "Ja'Marr Chase" - should be extracted as "Ja'Marr Chase" (with apostrophe)
- "Aaron Judge" - should be extracted as "Aaron Judge" (not just "Judge")

### Filtering Strategy
1. Remove all numbers, card numbers, and basic formatting first
2. Split into words and filter out all terms in the above lists
3. Join remaining words to form the player name
4. Clean up any remaining artifacts

### Common Issues to Watch For
- "Kaboom" appearing in player names (e.g., "Jack Grealish Kaboom")
- "Sapphire" appearing in player names (e.g., "Sapphire Drake Maye")
- "EL.HE13" being extracted as "EL Jasson" instead of "Jasson Dominguez"
- Missing apostrophes in names like "Ja'Marr Chase"
