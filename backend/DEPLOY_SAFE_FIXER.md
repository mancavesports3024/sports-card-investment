# Safe Summary Title Fixer Deployment

This deployment adds a new safe summary title fixer that:

1. **Only fixes clearly broken titles** - targets cards with summary titles < 40 characters
2. **Preserves existing data** - only adds missing information, doesn't remove anything
3. **Uses database-driven learning** - learns from existing good data patterns
4. **Conservative approach** - only updates if new title is longer and more descriptive
5. **Disables aggressive cron jobs** - removes the 1-2 minute cron jobs that were causing damage

## Changes Made:

1. **Created `safe-summary-title-fixer.js`** - New safe fixer based on database-driven approach
2. **Added API endpoint** - `/api/admin/safe-fix-summary-titles` for manual triggering
3. **Updated `railway.json`** - Replaced aggressive cron jobs with safe one (every 6 hours)
4. **Updated `index.js`** - Added new API endpoint

## How to Use:

1. **Manual fix**: Call the API endpoint to fix titles immediately
2. **Automatic fix**: The cron job will run every 6 hours to fix broken titles
3. **Safe operation**: Only fixes titles that are clearly broken (too short, missing info)

This should restore your summary titles to proper format without the aggressive damage caused by previous fixers.
